## About
Permissions is a library to make all easier permissions calls on Android.

## How to
**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```gradle
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
		compile 'com.github.jgabrielfreitas:Permissions:1.0.0'
}
```

#### Usage

> Check the `app` module for a sample


#### First of all implements `OnPermissionRequest`
+ `onPermissionAllowed()` - Permission allowed, be happy :grimacing:
+ `onPermissionDenied()` - Permission denied, this is not good :fire:
+ `onPermissionDeniedButAskAgain(PermissionToken token)` - The user don't allow your request permission, but you can ask again using `token.continuePermissionRequest();` until they click `never ask again`

### Request Permission

A location example


```java

// create a PermissionManager passing a Context and a OnPermissionRequest
LocationPermissionManager locationPermissionManager = new LocationPermissionManager(this, this);

// here, you request user location permission
locationPermissionManager.requestPermission();

```

The Dialog asking permission appears at this moment and you'll be called back when user tap at **DENY** or **ALLOW**.
